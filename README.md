# This repository contains scripts related to a Cross-lagged Panel Model and Random Intercepts Cross-lagged Panel Model that can be used to analyse questionnaire data on student agency, well-being and performance. The Rmarkdown files use the other scripts in the repository to compare four nested models that are fitted to the data. Later code chunks will tell you which of these models fits the data best and should be chosen for the analysis. These scripts have been written for a specific data set on student agency and cannot be easily be used for other datasets.
